# 🚀 Task 1: Basic React Application Development (MERN Stack)

✅ Completed as part of my internship at **Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**

This task focuses on setting up a foundational ReactJS application to understand the basic structure, development workflow, and core React concepts such as components, props, and state.

---

## 📌 Task Overview

- 🎯 **Goal**: Build a basic React application and explore its internal structure
- 🛠️ **Tech Used**: ReactJS, JSX, Node.js (for dependency management), npm
- 📆 **Deadline**: Completed within 7-day timeline as per internship schedule

---

## 🧰 Features Implemented

1. **React App Setup**
   - Used `npx create-react-app` to initialize the project
   - Verified folder structure and installed dependencies

2. **File/Folder Structure Exploration**
   - Understood purpose of:
     - `src/` – Contains React components, CSS, etc.
     - `public/` – Includes `index.html` (entry point) and static assets
     - `package.json` & `package-lock.json` – Dependency management
     - `node_modules/` – Installed packages
     - `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and other configs

3. **Component Creation**
   - Built a custom component using **JSX**
   - Used **props** and **state** to render dynamic content
   - Imported component inside `App.js`

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Ran the server with `npm start`
   - Observed real-time updates with **hot reloading**
   - Tested in browser environment

5. **Documentation**
   - Recorded file structure observations
   - Noted challenges and learnings
   - Practiced good coding and commenting habits
